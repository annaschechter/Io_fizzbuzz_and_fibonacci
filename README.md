Fizzbuzz & Fibonacci in io
==========================
Fizzbuzz and Fibonacci numbers are the week five exercises at Makers Academy. As a preliminary to JavaScript we were introduced to io. 
Specification
-------------
Fizzbuzz is a popular coding kata and also a game. The rules of Fizzbuzz are as follows:
* the game is played for numbers from 1 to 100
* the numbers are listed in order
* a number is replaced with the word "Fizz" whenever it is divisible by 3 
* a number is replaced with the word "Buzz" whenever it is divisible by 5
* a number is replaced with the word "Fizzbuzz" whenever it is divisible by 15

Fibonacci numbers is the sequence of numbers where the first two numbers are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. My code provides the algorithm for finding the nth Fibonacci number.
